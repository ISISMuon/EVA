Releasing versions
.....................
Users can download the latest release executable of EVA from the releases panel on the right in the code tab of the repository.
The executable available on the "releases" panel of the repository is updated manually. This means that the although the
the latest source code will always be available to users from the repository, an executable download of the latest version may not be.

The latest release should be updated in reasonable increments - versions. It is up to the developers to decide if the main branch should update in
"large batches" - in which case it could make sense to release a new version every time the main branch is updated. Or,
you could wait to update the latest release until enough changes have been made for it to be considered a new version.

The goal is to avoid having users to constantly have to update their EVA version. More can be read about versioning here_.
